First of all, in main file I created an application window.
Next, I created a Calculator class to handle the core logic of the application. In the class I have methods:
1. __init__ to initializes the calculator object with an empty expression.
2. add_to_expression, to add a new character (e.g., digit, operator) to the current expression.
3. remove_last_character, to removes the last character from the current expression.
4. clear_expression, to clear the entire expression, setting it back to an empty string.
5. calculate, to evaluates the current mathematical expression and returns the result.
6. get_expression, to returns the current mathematical expression stored in expression.

How to run my code.
1. Push the run button, and you will see a calculator.
2. If you want to perform some operations with nums, then push the buttons with numbers and operations you want to perform.
3. Click equal sign and you will see the answer.
